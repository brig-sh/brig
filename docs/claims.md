# Claims and the tests behind them

[security.md](security.md) promises what the guest can and cannot reach. A
promise nothing checks holds until a refactor ends it. Each row below quotes
one sentence from that page and names the tests that defend it.

`script/check-claims.sh` reads this table on every pull request. It fails when
a quoted sentence is gone from the page, or when a named test no longer
exists. `make claims` runs the same check after its self-test.

## Reading a row

The claim cell quotes the page. Only the part in double quotes is matched, so
a note in parentheses after it says which part of the sentence the row covers.
Quote the whole sentence, through its period, so that a qualifier added to it
on the page ends the match. The page wraps its prose, and the match ignores
line breaks and runs of spaces.

The section cell names the heading the sentence sits under. The quote has to
be under that heading or under one nested in it.

Every line after the table's delimiter row is a row, up to the first blank
line, with or without its outer pipes. A line there that is not three cells
fails the check, and so does a pipe line outside the table.

Each defence in the last column is one token:

- `go:TestName` is a Go test, found as `func TestName(` in a `_test.go` file.
- `smoke:<text>` is an assertion in `script/smoke.sh`, found as its
  `ok "<text>"` line.
- `vm:<check>` is a check in `script/claims-vm.sh`, found as its
  `vm_check <check>` line.

A `vm` check needs a booted sandbox, and CI has no runtime. `make claims-vm`
builds brig from this checkout and runs those checks against that binary
where hull or nerdctl is on `PATH`. It skips where neither is. Run it before a
merge that touches the run path. Run by hand, `script/claims-vm.sh` tests the
brig on `PATH` unless `BRIG` names another. The CI check resolves a `vm` row
by name and lists it as not yet run.

Any other token, a row with none, or text beside the tokens fails the check.
