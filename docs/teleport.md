# Teleportable sessions

A teleportable session owns all of its storage. Its guest root is a block
disk, its guest home is a directory on that disk, and no host directory is
shared into it. Brig gives a session this shape so that a later release can
move the running sandbox to another host as a whole. This page describes only
the session mode. Brig does not move a session yet.

## Start one

```bash
brig run --teleportable claude
```

Or set it in a profile, for every session of that profile:

```yaml
hypervisor: hvi
teleportable: true
```

A session that was started teleportable stays teleportable. Later commands on
its ref do not need the flag. Brig records the property in its session index.

## What changes

| | Ordinary session | Teleportable session |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guest root | the runtime's default | `block`, always |
| Guest home | a host directory, shared in read-write | a directory on the sandbox's own disk |
| Project | optional, shared in at `/work/<name>` | none |
| Backend | any | hull's `hvi` only |
| Network, policy, published ports | as configured | the same |
| Credentials | delivered into a tmpfs by `hull exec` | the same |
| Onboarding seed | written into the host home | written into the guest home, inside the guest |
| `--skills`, `BRIG_GIT_CONFIG` | copy files into the host home | refused: there is no host home |

`brig info` and `brig plan` print a `TELEPORTABLE` row. `brig ls` prints a
`TELEPORTABLE` column, and `(in the sandbox disk)` in place of a workspace.
The `--json` documents of `ls`, `info` and `plan` carry `"teleportable": true`.

## What you lose

- **A host-visible home.** You cannot open the agent's files from the host.
  Use `brig sh <ref>` to reach them.
- **A project mount.** Copy the work in from inside the sandbox, for example
  with `git clone`.
- **`brig stop`.** hull cannot start a stopped sandbox again without making
  a new one, and a new one has a new disk. So stopping a teleportable session
  ends it. The next run refuses and names `brig rm <ref>`. A host reboot
  stops the sandbox too, with the same result.
- **Changes that recreate the sandbox.** An ordinary session restarts onto a
  new sandbox when its network or policy changes. A teleportable session
  refuses instead, because the restart deletes its disk.

`brig rm` deletes the disk and everything in it.

## What Brig refuses

| Request | Exit code |
| --- | --- |
| `--teleportable` with a project or `--home` on the same line | `2` |
| A project, `--home` or `BRIG_WORKSPACE` for a session that is teleportable from its profile or its record | `1` |
| `--skills`, `BRIG_SKILLS`, `BRIG_GIT_CONFIG` or a `BRIG_ROOTFS_TYPE` other than `block` | `1` |
| `--teleportable` for a session that already has a host home | `1` |
| A run path other than hull on `hvi` | `7` |

Each refusal names the setting to drop, or `brig rm <ref>` when the session
has to start over.
